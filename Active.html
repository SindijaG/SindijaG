						<h2>Denmark</h2>
						<p>Denmark is a great country in Europe. Nature is<br> 
						beautiful, people are happy, and food is tasty!<br>  
						Living in Denmark for a summer I realize how<br> amazing 
						this place is, and that one day I would<br> like to live 
						here. People here are active and<br> healthy. Copenhagen 
						is very popular tourist spot during the summer.
						And why not? This place have everything. However,
						Denmark is not only known as the happiest people land,
						but also one of the most expensive places in 
						Europe. But it is still worth to go there!</p>

						<h2>New York</h2>
						<p>This city is huge. It seemed that there is no<br> 
						ending. Walking through streets with crazy tall<br> 
						buildings and pushinging through the masses of<br> 
						people was interesting experience. This city is<br> 
						a nice destiny for couple days, but for living<br>  
						it is to overwellming. I can only admire New<br> 
						Yokers because for me this city was too big and<br> 
						croudy. If you are in New York check out most popular 
						places and visit American Museum of Natural History!</p>

						<h2>Moscow</h2>
						<p>A place where traditions and historical places<br> 
						meets. Cities such as Moscow and Saint-Petersburg 
						will break stereotypes and change your thoughts 
						about Russia. Moscow is very modern city with 
						skycrapers and new technologies, however, it still
						holds her traditions with ortodox churces and 
						ornaments. Russian cuisine is very simple- borsch, 
						dumplings, crepes, etc., but the taste is very rich. 
						Saint-Petersburg is one of my favorite cities becasue 
						it is traditional and beautiful in a special way. 
						Saint-Petersburg is must visit city in the Russia.</p>
